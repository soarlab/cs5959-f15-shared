pedantic comments from me are marked with (p) they are really picky and should
be taken with heaps of salt

classifier.c:
	I changed all occurrences of "_y1" with "y1" and was able to compile fine
	    I'm wondering why you had issues (can you send me compiler
	    version etc?)
	atol is bad (you didn't know that at the time)
	    - you did do checking that the args are numbers
	(p) line 139: I think you could also allow '+'
	Should probably use constants for 2^30-1 and return codes
	Incredible commenting!
	Great naming conventions, I never had to look at the body of a func to
	    tell what it did.
	Overall clear, easy to read and understand code with a high emphasis on
	    encapsulating high level concerns from details.

classifier.h:
	(p) I was taught to include only what you use in a file itself, but
	    there is also a school of thought to #include everything in .h files
	    to hide details and allow for pch file generation
	Proper include guarding

makefile:
	Use of makefile variables would make this more flexible
	A clean rule would come in useful

readme.txt:
	Everything someone needs to know to run your tests.

test_script.pl:
	I was unable to get it to run.
	I also am scared of perl, so it might just know that ;-)
	I don't read perl, but it is well commented.
	From what I understand, when a test fails you say what was expected and
	    what actually came out. Quite useful for debugging.
