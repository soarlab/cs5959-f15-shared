*more descriptive variable name on line 91
*consider using strtoll instead of strtol to avoid overflow issues
*consider using constants for strings and numbers you use frequently (ie: "error\n")
*I may be wrong since I didn't test it, but is line 96 correct?  You might have to use strcmp() to compare the strings...
*I'm not sure why you are looping in the check_size function.
*I would recommend using a qsort compare function to sort the sides to help determine the hypotenuse in your check_angle function
*The makefile does not appear to be working for me.
*I will run the testing script when the compile works.  One suggestion is what the professor mentioned in class and that is to use a lot of edge cases.
