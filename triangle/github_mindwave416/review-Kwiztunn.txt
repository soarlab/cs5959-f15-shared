-Needs sys.exit on incorrect input.
-I like the full separation of determining sides and angles into thir own helper methods very readable code
-Header file for predeclaration of methods also makes for readable code probably a better habbit than predeclaring in the c file.
-Excellent parse error checking. Combined with overflow checking proper bounded input. 
-Good test cases on the border cases of overflow
-Make file needs a -std=c99 call in the triangle_classifier.o file to compile on my linux machine. (Kristen fixed this already during our class review. All she needed was to declare the int i,j; before using them in a for loop.)
