Leland Stenquist Code Review of AJJohnson's code

General:

I am very impressed by your code it is very thourough.  
I like your use of Enums.
I also wish I had known the shoelace formula.  That was a great way to tell if the triangle is colinear.
Your testing file is organized very well. It is good clean code.
You are very thorough is your testing.  You could add a test the check invalid input where the first part is a number and the next part is a not a number.  Ex: 24hello 

Obviously you alread know this, but you should probably use a long long instead of a long. It will help you avoid overflow.
