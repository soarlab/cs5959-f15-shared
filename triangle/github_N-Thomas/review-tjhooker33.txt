triangle_analyzer.c:

Could use more comments, maybe comments for functions.

I like the equal slopes check. I didn't think about solving the colinear issue that way. 
But, if that's in there, what is the point of check vert horz lines? Isn't it a line if any two have equal slopes?
I might just be missing something about your solution.

Might be a bit simpler to do checks for euqilateral, scalene and isoseles printing that and then printing the next check with the line break after.
That way the number of checks scales linearly. 

Checking for duplicate points and checking for colinearity is redundant. 

compute function could be named better. 

triangle_test.py:

Tests look great. 

Makefile:

looks great. 

Overall your code looks really good. I am really struggling to find anything to say on this code review. Nice Work.
