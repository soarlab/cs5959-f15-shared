-Add test cases, max possible triangle, input out of range, letters, etc..

-More comments on the code would be helpful to determine whats going on

-I didnt notice if/how you were checking an input for characters or if the input was outside the given range (–(2^30 – 1) to (2^30 – 1)).

-Line 96 Im not exactly sure, but there may be rounding issues with the conversions from radians to degrees

 Just personal preference but the heavy use of structs at the beginning made the code difficult for me to read. 
 
 Really good code, not much else to say.
