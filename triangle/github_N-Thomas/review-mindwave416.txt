triangle.c:

Very easy to read code, I appreciate that. 

atol is probably bad as discussed in class. 

I don't really understand how your input check (for bad inputs) works but assuming it does it looks good. 

Unless I am misunderstanding, your checkpoints function checks if points are on a line perpendicular or parallel 
to the origin but not if its on a line with slope.

Commenting is pretty good but some comments to explain why you are doing the math operations that you do for people 
like me who are rusty on things like the dot product would help.

The sideLen function is quite a bit simpler than the other ones I have seen. Looks like it should work just as well as well. 
Nice.

testScript.pl:

Tests look good. Maybe add a check for invalid input and maybe some max size triangles that are slightly off of being right
or isoseles to make sure it checks out. 

Makefile:

Simple and fine. Looks just like mine.
