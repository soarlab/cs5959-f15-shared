# <TrianglClassifier.c>

# line 19: main has too many lines
#   try to abstract the functionality away from main by
#   moving functional units into their own functions
# line 26: don't use multiline comments for a single line
#   you can stil do: /* some comment */ , just do it on 1 line
# line 39: most loops start with variable i, j, then k
#   when I see the loop with "int j = 1" I start looking for i
# line 40: replace "atol" with "strtol"
# line 56: i like that you placed all the points into an array
#   you could just create a macro or function that would return x1, etc
# line 75: floating point... you probably want to avoid this
# line 82: nice work checking colinearity, very clever
# line 107: you can determine the type of triangle without angles,
#   just use the lengths
# line 120: no need for comments when the print statement is obvious
# line 148: main is missing a default return value

# <tests.py>

# line 5: asserts are great but what happens if the first assert fails?
#   i believe non of the other tests will run at that point
#   i recommend using Python's unittest if you want to use asserts
#   unittests will allow a test case to fail an assertion and still
#     continue to execute the remaining tests
# line 27: the comments here are obvious when reading the assert call
#   maybe use more of a block comment for a block of tests
# test cases are very clean and easy to read, nice work
