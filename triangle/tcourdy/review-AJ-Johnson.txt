*Consider using constant values for non changing values (ie: max_val, min_val,
 etc.)

*Consider using the built in error checking of strtoll.

*Recommend upgrading to long long data type instead of long to avoid overflow
 issues.

*The for-loops could be considered a bit confusing at first glance. Consider
 adding comments to them so that future developers who look at code can 
 spend less time figuring out what is going on.

*The angle check function could be more succint by using a qsort compare to
 figure out the largest side before doing law of cosines check.

*We spoke a bit about the 'I' flag in your make file.  Since we were both
 unsure of its purpose I have included its description below.  I'll let you
 be the judge if you need to include it or not. 

-I dir
           Add the directory dir to the list of directories to be searched for
           header files.  Directories named by -I are searched before the
           standard system include directories.  If the directory dir is a
           standard system include directory, the option is ignored to ensure
           that the default search order for system directories and the
           special treatment of system headers are not defeated .  If dir
           begins with "=", then the "=" will be replaced by the sysroot
           prefix; see --sysroot and -isysroot.
