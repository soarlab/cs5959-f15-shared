You're incorrectly comparing char* s to ints when you're looking for your input errors (You might mean to be using aoti there)
You don't have a return in those same if statements, so they fall into the rest of your code (which I don't think is intentional)
Your comparison of arguments 0, 2, and 4 for equality (and arguments 1, 3, and 6 for equality) is insufficient to check for triangle linearity (for example the line 0 0 1 1 2 2 or the line 0 0 1 2 2 4 would both fail to be detected)

In addition, the sqrt function doesn't work on longs, only on doubles.
(So you need to convert to and from ints and doubles)

There are plenty of other things you should probably fix, but that's the extent of what I saw on my first look through. I'd fix those before anything else.
