pedantic comments from me are marked with (p) they are really picky and should
be taken with heaps of salt


Makefile:
	Love the CFLAGS
	Nice definition of a build process, easy to add to
	(p) clean should have ".PHONY: clean" above it

readme:
	Kudos for having one!
	It was a bit bare ;-)

tester.py:
	Quick and dirty yet highly readable
	With a few more test cases the 'not tested' could be removed

triangle.c:
	static const for global, Yay!
	(p) mallocs are not checked
	line 63: incrementing i,the for variable, is confusing and error prone
	no check for input such as "123apple"
	arg parsing could use more comments, especially surrounding the logic
	    with i
	pow(2,30)-1 is repeated, making changing of the bound harder it should
	    be a global
	func find_sides: I cant figure out the names "pees" and "esses"
	func put_longest_in_middle: very descriptive name
	Overall easy to read code.
